+ Task 1: Unit Test 
1. Is the project completed successfully?
- Yes, the core functionalities of the Personal Finance Manager have been implemented and tested. Users can log in, manage transactions, set savings goals, and persist their data.
2. If yes, is your software bug-free?

3. If yes, is it ready to publish? Where?
- Yes, the project is ready for academic submission and internal sharing:
  ✅ GitHub (private or public classroom repo)
  ✅ School network drive
  ✅ Group archive .zip file for final submission
4. Otherwise, can you find those bugs?
- Not applicable – no critical bugs were found at this time. However, some input validation edge cases (e.g., non-numeric input) might cause exceptions.
5. If not completed, do you wish to complete it?
- Not applicable. The main project is completed.
6. User Manual
- A detailed user manual is being developed(Reademe.md), which will guide new users through installation and usage.
7. Can you train other teams on how to use your software?
- Yes. A training slide presentation (Task 4) will be created to explain system setup, project structure, and maintenance workflow for new developers.
